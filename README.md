# python_webrtc

This repository will build a 1-to-1 video chat, where each peer streams directly to the other peer, there is no need for a intermediary server to handle video content. However, a 3rd party server is required for signalling that stores shared data for stream negotiation. Please refer to my basic JS version of this approach, in which I will know implement it with Python and it's WebRTC equivalent aiortc.
